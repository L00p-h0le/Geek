## Summary of Edits

### `App.tsx` (4 changes)
- Added "Welcome to G33K / Your personalized Wallet Generator" heading
- Wrapped blockchain selection in `{mnemonic && (...)}` so it only shows after seed phrase generation
- Changed warning from "Losing this will result in wallet loss" to "Anyone with seed phrase will have access to your wallets. NEVER SHARE IT!!"
- Removed "Back" button from wallet page header

### `Ethereum.tsx` (2 changes)
- Removed standalone Balance section from wallet view (it stays inside Send ETH dialog only)
- Added `resetDialogState()` helper; called when dialog opens to clear form fields, errors, and tx state

### `App.tsx` — Page Restructure
- Split landing into two views: Welcome page (no mnemonic) and Seed Phrase page (after generation)
- Welcome page: only large welcome text + "Generate Seed Phrase" button
- Seed phrase page: Recovery Phrase heading, phrase grid, copy/regenerate, warning, blockchain selection
- Welcome text bumped to `text-4xl` with `tracking-[0.25em]`; subtitle to `text-lg` with `tracking-[0.15em]`
- Regenerate button moved inline into the seed phrase card (next to Copy)
